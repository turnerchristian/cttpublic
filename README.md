# old portfolio
# lmao @ the css file size

This was done after 1 week of learning to become a developer. 

There are a lot of very bad decisions here and weird choices but I have learned from all of them and really do not like the portfolio anymore haha. But it's shows how far I have come so I am keeping it up.

The project was only meant to use HTML and CSS which is why it does not contain any other front end technologies which I have since learnt.

It also has placeholder information as there was nothing else to add yet at the time.
